    <h2>Solar Entry / Lunar Exit Explained</h2>
    <p>This DAO works like a living organism, following natural human cycles. People do not burn out or disappear — they have active and rest phases.</p>
    <div class="solar">
      <h3>🌞 Solar Entry</h3>
      <p>When members join, they arrive as the <strong>Sun</strong>: active, contributing skills, ideas, and presence. Their roles are clear and contributions are integrated into the DAO governance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="lunar">
      <h3>🌙 Lunar Exit</h3>
      <p>When members need a break, they enter a <strong>Lunar Phase</strong>: stepping back from active roles, pausing responsibilities, and storing their contributions safely. This ensures the DAO continues operating smoothly, and members can return when ready.</p>
    </div>
    <p>For investors, this system means stability and reduced risk. Even if a key member takes a pause, the DAO continues functioning, and all contributions are preserved.</p>

    <h2>Example Conversation</h2>
    <div class="conversation">
      <p><span class="speaker">Investor Ana:</span> Hi Juan, I'm interested in investing in your DAO, but I'm worried what happens if key members step back.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Juan (DAO Member):</span> I understand, Ana. We use a system called <strong>Solar Entry / Lunar Exit</strong>.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ana:</span> Solar Entry? Lunar Exit?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Juan:</span> When someone joins, they arrive as the Sun 🌞: contributing energy, ideas, and time. That's the Solar Entry.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ana:</span> And if someone needs to pause?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Juan:</span> They enter the Lunar Phase 🌙. They pause active roles, transfer responsibilities, and their contributions are safely stored in the DAO vault. They can return later without losing their work.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ana:</span> So the DAO keeps running even if someone is resting?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Juan:</span> Exactly. Nothing is lost, and your investment is protected. Members return ripened and ready to contribute again.</p>
